About Project-

Built an end-to-end Fake News Detection system using NLP with TF-IDF + Logistic Regression and transformer-based models (Tiny-BERT / DistilBERT) for binary text classification.

Implemented text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization) and evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.

Designed a CPU-optimized pipeline with unified inference to compare classical ML and deep learning approaches on real-world news articles.
